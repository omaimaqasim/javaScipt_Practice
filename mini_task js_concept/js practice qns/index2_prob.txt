/*
CHALLENGE: Compressed Frequency Encoder

Problem:
You are given a sentence (string).

Your task is to:
1. Remove all spaces from the string
2. Convert all characters to lowercase
3. Count the frequency of each character
4. Store the result in an array of strings in the format:
   character + frequency   (example: "a3")
5. Sort the resulting array:
   - First by frequency in descending order
   - If frequencies are equal, sort alphabetically by character

Input Example:
let input = "JavaScript Is Challenging";

Expected Output:
["a3", "i3", "s3", "c2", "g2", "l2", "n2", "r2", "t2", "e1", "h1", "j1", "p1", "v1"]



Goal:
This problem tests your understanding of:
- String traversal
- Array searching
- Nested loops
- Manual sorting logic
- Algorithmic thinking
